# Fetching data from Yandex Managed Service for Apache Kafka® to Yandex Managed Service for ClickHouse®

You can deliver data from [Managed Service for Apache Kafka®](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/managed-kafka) cluster topics to a [Managed Service for ClickHouse®](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/managed-clickhouse) cluster in real time. This data will be automatically inserted into ClickHouse® tables on the [Kafka engine](https://clickhouse.com/docs/engines/table-engines/integrations/kafka). See [this tutorial](https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/tutorials/dataplatform/fetch-data-from-mkf) to learn how to prepare the infrastructure for Managed Service for ClickHouse® and Managed Service for Apache Kafka® using Terraform. This repository contains the configuration file you will need: [data-from-kafka-to-clickhouse.tf](data-from-kafka-to-clickhouse.tf).
